In this dissertation, I have been investigating the level of gentrification and displacement in East London following the extensions of the London Overground and Dockland Light Railway. 

Employing a quantitative research approach, the study utilizes methods such as Difference-in-differences analysis and K-means cluster analysis. The implementation of the research also involves adopting tools like QGIS and python scripting. 

More comprehensive and detailed results will be made available here upon my completion of the dissertation in August.
