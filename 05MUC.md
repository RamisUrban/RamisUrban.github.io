## Introduction

The "Inside Out" project is a quantitative research project led by Dr Fabian Wenner to investigate the “Zweite Stammstrecke” Express Rail Project in Munich and its indication of urbanisation and regionalization. 

Based on an integrated urban and transport planning philosophy, a digital tool to assess the balance of public transport accessibility and functional density at stations in the Munich Metropolitan Region (MMR) is developed, which also leads to further recommendations of planning strategies.

## Clusters of the Nodes

By performing a K-mean cluster analysis, seven clusters of the nodes are identified. The following spider maps for each cluster show the typical levels of different measured indicators that reveal their spatial characteristics and development potentials to a certain extent. Also, for each type of node, a guiding planning principle is given as a reference for their future development.
