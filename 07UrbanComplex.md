## Context

North Sichuan Road was once a bustling high street in Shanghai, characterized by clusters of local household businesses and vendors, and a vibrant public life. However, in recent decades, the rise of online shopping has led to a decline in local businesses, exacerbated by the trend of gentrification and the privatization of public space. As a result, the project aims to revitalize this area, located at the north end of North Sichuan Road, by creating a dynamic public space that serves as a refuge for all members of the community. By doing so, the project seeks to not only revive the area's once-thriving public life, but also to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone in the city.

## Concept

In our design, we aimed to go beyond the initial project mission by creating a continuous timber structure around the podium of the two towers. These timber structures provide shade and shelter to accommodate a wider variety of public activities in contrast to the semi-public space commonly seen in Shanghai. 

Under these timber structures, tracks, sports fields, skate parks, and multiple "public cubes" that could be used to host community events and provide shelter for the homeless are proposed. Additionally, we extended the umbrellas across the river to create a more seamless connection between the green space and the surrounding urban fabric. Together, these elements form a new urban park we call the "Urban Umbrellas."
