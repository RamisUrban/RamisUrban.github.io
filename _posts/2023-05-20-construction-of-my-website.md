I began construct my website the end of April in 2023, and now I have nearly completed the first version of it. Despite that the blog page is still quite empty(That is why I am creating this small piece of writing here), it is an indeed progress to celebrate as I have zero experience in constructing a website. 

I thought everything would be simple at the very begining, particularly after I have found a template on github. However, it turned out to be more difficult than I imagined. This is partially because I keep wanting adding something new such as embedding video and PDF file on webpage, using two column gallery-like display, which were not originally not available in the template. Thanks to the valuable guidance from some random youtube video and ChaptGPT(My AI tutor)'s debugging and revising, I managed to bring my website to its look today along my daily study. 

Apart from these technical problems, the construction of the website content was quite a happy prosess because I finally found an oppotunties to review some of my favourate projects I have been involved with, which I feel proud of(even if they are still not perfect), which compose of valuable life experience of mine. Through this process, they also made me think of my dear teachers and friends currently around different corners of the world and the days I spent with them. 

Now, since the main part of my website has been completed, my next step is to start running my blog during the summer break to keep record of my ideas and story. I hope this could also be a new starting point of my life, leaving campus and pursuing a career.

Before I bring this piece to a close, I would like to convey my final words of well wishes to all those who are reading: **May your day be filled with happiness and new adventures.**
