### Introduction

The concept of land value capture, which means reverting a portion of the increased value of land resulting from public investments or other factors to the public, has been a topic of significant debate in recent years. This essay examines some of the critics around the existing land value capture mechanisms and then discusses why we might attach more importance to the public ownership of land in achieving wider societal benefits.

### The Concept and Form of Land Value Capture

The idea of capturing the land value could be traced back to Henry George's single tax on land. In George's concept, "the increases in the value of land should accrue to society as a whole and not to individual owners since it was the collectivity that created the value arising from the use of land". Nowadays, there are mainly two types of land value capture mechanisms in the UK, namely the Section 106 and Community Infrastructure Levy, to serve this objective:

#### Section 106

In section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, local authorities enter into legally binding agreements with developers through negotiation. In such an agreement, which can vary case by case, the developers might pay for certain public services, ranging from education and health care contributions to sports, recreation and affordable housing. The Section 106 obligation can also restrict the development or use of the land in a certain way or require a sum or sums to be paid to the authorities on a specific date or periodically. Through this effort, the local authorities chase to mitigate the negative impact of the development and improve the community buy-in. Meanwhile, it helps to deliver mixed communities by requiring the contribution of affordable housing from private developers. In such a way, it can be seen as a cross-subsidy of affordable housing(Crook & Whitehead, 2022). 

#### The Community Infrastructure Levy

Another way to capture land value in the UK is through the Community Infrastructure Levy. Compared to Section 106, whose implementation is subject to negotiation and can differ with different geographical contexts, the Community Infrastructure Levy is a more fixed form to capture land value. It is introduced in Planning Act 2008 and has been adopted since April 2010. It provides a clearer, faster and fairer way for development contribution, which applies to any new development larger than 100 square metres or creates a new dwelling(Garton et al., 2019). The payments through Community Infrastructure Levy can provide resources for infrastructure that support the development of the areas.  

### Critics Over Current Land Value Capture Mechanisms

However, critics have pointed out that the existing mechanisms still show a dependence on marketisation and contractural trend in planning governance. And this might be exposed to compromisation of the wider social value and miss the opportunities that could have been brought through land development.

Firstly, the current land value capture mechanism cannot secure a sufficient amount of contribution from the developer to the local people. In Section 106, for instance, the conditions are highly negotiable and can depend on the negotiation skills of the local authorities, and there is no guarantee that the developers can create enough facilities that cater to local people’s use. Worse still, in many cases, much of the compensation might not compensate for the suffering of the residents who might be displaced after the development. This can be seen in the development of Nine Elms in London (Livingstone et al., 2021), where even if affordable housing is taken into account during development, the soaring housing price can still squeeze out existing tenants. Similar problems also hold for the value captured through tax and levies, which is only a minor number compared to the profit the developers can make from land development. In the recent development of Battersea Power Station, the contribution made by the Battersea Power Station Development Company is only ￡200 million, which is only half of their residential sales in the year 2022. Meanwhile, such payment can be subject to the risk of abuse by the government, which makes it far from capable of making a sufficient contribution to the local community. 

Second, we should rethink the term “value” in urban development. Though current land-value capture mechanisms aim at capturing the “value” into public welfare, it is mostly done in a monetary form. However, the “value” created for the public could have taken a more comprehensive form that embeds different social and environmental components into the development process. In order words, the current land value capture mechanisms miss the opportunities or benefits that could have been synergized by the densification scheme, such as creating rooftop green parks, delivering social housing units, integrating new greywater treatment facilities, or introducing community wind turbines. Under the current approach, it is more likely that the private sectors, such as developers and financial cooperations, continue to dominate the urban development and regeneration projects, which has continuously led to exclusive and monotonous urban development scheme. In this process, the power of communities is "systematically undermined by privatization and the regulatory complexity and contractualism that go with it "(Raco, 2014, p46), despite that the “value” is claimed to be captured. Thus, this highlights the importance of a new framework to guide future property development to maximize the beneficiaries of value generated by the densification processes, where longer-term social and community benefits instead of shorter-term money gains are prioritized (Livingstone, 2021).

### Think Beyond Land Value Capture

From the discussion above, we can realize that the existing land value capture mechanism is not ideal because it is simply a design to fix market failures and value extraction mechanisms instead of challenging the existing market-led planning and privatisation of urban governance. Though it ensures some of the gains produced by property transactions can go into government coffers or support new public projects, the structure of property markets remains unchanged (Fainstein, 2012). That is why we might think about public ownership to achieve further public control over the land. In fact, according to Fainstein(2012), public ownership of land might be the only way to fully achieve Henry George’s ambition. And there are different methods to achieve public ownership of land:

Public control by the government is one possible. For instance, in Amsterdam, the use of land banking arose from a social democratic commitment to equity and good planning that has been sustained for almost a century. The municipal government owns over 90 per cent of the land within its border and leases the land out when it needs to be developed through multiple conditions and criteria (Faludi & van der Valk, 1994). This can be a significant local government tool for equitable growth (Lowe,2022). For profitable development programmes such as private housing, and commercial development, a “residual rent” is calculated based on expected returns determined through negotiation (Fainstein, 2012). The gains from increases in land value are used to subsidize new development projects such as public transit, which made all parts of the city accessible. Consequently, more inclusive neighbourhoods can be seen in Amsterdam where middle-class households shared housing estates with poor and working-class families (Musterd & Ostendorf 2003). 

Community Land Trust is another bottom-up mechanism to achieve public ownership of land, where land is owned and managed by a non-profit community organization when residents sign long-term lease agreements giving them ownership rights over their housing units(DeFilippis, 2004). By placing land ownership in the hands of the community, CLTs can ensure that the land is used for community benefit and that development occurs in a way that is consistent with community needs and values(Davis, 2015). By removing land from the speculative market and placing it in the hands of the community,  the development of the land is no more profit-oriented. It is thus able to provide truly affordable housing, community gardens, or other social and environmentally beneficial. 

Hence, potential can be seen from these examples by shifting from the current private-led land development towards a more public-oriented and community-led way of development. 

### Conclusion

To sum up, the original idea of land value capture is largely targeting the maximisation of public beneficiaries in land development, while the current practice of it, at least in the UK, seems not satisfactory, due to its market-oriented feature. From my own point of view, the opportunities for future land value capture lie in the combination of public ownership of land and wider public participation in the land development process. Only through this, can we achieve wider societal benefits from land development and get rid of the dominance of private interest and the problematic contractualism of governance ties to it in contemporary urban development.
